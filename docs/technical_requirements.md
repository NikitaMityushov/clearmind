## Objective:

- To develop a mobile Android application that allows users to chat with the GPT-3 neural network and provides authorization using Google accounts.

## Scope:

- The app will be developed for Android devices and will support multiplayer functionality.
- Users will be able to sign in to the app using their Google account.
- The app will provide a limited number of free requests per day for each user. After a user has exhausted their free requests, they will be able to continue using the service by viewing an advertisement or paying for a subscription.
- The app will use the Android API to send and receive messages from the GPT-3 neural network.

## Functional Requirements:

- The app must provide a user-friendly interface for the chat.
- The app must allow users to sign in using their Google account.
- The app must track the number of free requests used by each user and limit the number of requests that can be made per day.
- The app must provide a way for users to continue using the service after they have exhausted their free requests, either by viewing an advertisement or paying for a subscription.
- The app must use the Android API to send and receive messages from the GPT-3 neural network.

## Technical Requirements:

- The app must be developed using Android Studio and the Android SDK.
- The app must support Android devices with a minimum API level of 21 (Android 5.0 Lollipop).
- The app must use the Google Sign-In API for user authorization.
- The app must use in-app billing and interstitial ads to implement the subscription and advertising models.

## Subscription Model:

- The app will offer a paid subscription that allows users to continue using the service after they have exhausted their free requests.
- The subscription will be managed using the Android in-app billing API.
- The subscription will be implemented as a recurring subscription, charged on a regular basis (e.g. monthly) until the user cancels.
- The app will track whether a user has an active subscription and allow access to the service as long as the subscription is active.
- The app will provide a user interface for managing subscriptions, including options to purchase and cancel a subscription.
- The app will handle subscription failures (e.g. if the user's payment method is declined) and provide appropriate error messages or prompts to the user.

## Testing and Maintenance:

- The app must be thoroughly tested on a variety of Android devices to ensure that it is functioning correctly.
- The app must be maintained and updated to ensure compatibility with new versions of Android and any changes to the GPT-3 neural network.
